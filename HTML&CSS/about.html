				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Sam, and at 37 years old, I have enthusiastically embarked on the journey to transform my lifelong passion for (gaming) computers
					and digital creation into a professional skill set. Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and rooted in the Netherlands since our flight in 1998, I
					have always been fascinated by the logic and limitless possibilities offered by the PC.
				</p>
				<p>
					My path toward programming was not without its challenges; mental struggles caused me to delay this career transition until later in life.
					However, this experience has granted me significant resilience, perseverance, and a deep understanding of personal growth. I now view my
					life experience as a unique perspective when analyzing complex problems and patiently approaching new code.
				</p>
				<p>
					This portfolio serves as my personal logbook and a showcase of my commitment to becoming a Full-Stack Developer. My current focus lies on
					JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development. Here, you will find projects that reflect my progress in web development, where I
					strive to create functional and user-friendly applications. In the future, I aim to expand my knowledge to include Java, allowing me to
					build robust and scalable enterprise solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of coding, I gain energy from my family, music, entertainment, and sports. I am a lover of long walks in nature and a good book.
				</p>
				<p>I invite you to follow my progress and see how this late start is driving me toward dedicated and thoughtful work.</p>
